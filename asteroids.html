        <p class="card-text text-light h4">Asteroids, sometimes called minor planets, are rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.</p>
        <p class="card-text text-light h6">Most asteroids can be found orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter within the main asteroid belt. Asteroids range in size from Vesta – the largest at about 329 miles (530 kilometers) in diameter – to bodies that are less than 33 feet (10 meters) across. The total mass of all the asteroids combined is less than that of Earth's Moon.
            The current known asteroid count is 1,372,879. This count includes dwarf planets, and objects in the Kuiper Belt – a doughnut-shaped region of icy bodies extending far beyond the orbit of Neptune. Scientists call these worlds Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), or trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Trans-Neptunian objects are objects in our solar system that have an orbit beyond Neptune. There may be millions of other icy worlds in the Kuiper Belt that were left over from the formation of our solar system.

            <p class="card-text text-light">One of the most intriguing objects in the main asteroid belt, Psyche is a giant metal rich asteroid, about three times farther away from the Sun than is Earth.
                Psyche has an irregular, potato-like shape. If it were sliced in half horizontally at the equator – picture a squished oval – it would measure 173 miles (280 kilometers) across at its widest point and 144 miles (232 kilometers) long. Its surface area is 64,000 square miles (165,800 square kilometers).
                Up until recently, the scientific consensus was that the asteroid Psyche consisted mostly of metal. The more recent data indicates that the asteroid is possibly a mix of metal and silicate, the same material found in glass and sand. The best analysis indicates that Psyche is likely made of a mixture of rock and metal, with metal composing 30% to 60% of its volume. The asteroid’s composition has been determined by radar observations and by the measurements of the asteroid’s thermal inertia (how quickly an object gains or re-radiates heat).
                By combining radar and optical observations, scientists generated a 3D model of Psyche that shows evidence of two craterlike depressions. It suggests that there is significant variation in the metal content and color of the asteroid over its surface. But until NASA's Psyche mission sees the asteroid Psyche up close for the first time, we will not know what it actually looks like.

            <p class="card-text text-light">Bennu is a small, near-Earth asteroid that passes close to Earth about every six years. It was the target of NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission to collect an asteroid sample and bring it to Earth.</p>
            <p class="card-text text-light">Bennu is a carbon-rich asteroid that is about one-third of a mile (half a kilometer) wide at its equator.
                An ancient relic of our solar system’s early days, asteroid Bennu has seen more than 4.5 billion years of history. Scientists think that within 10 million years of our solar system’s formation, Bennu’s present-day composition was already established.               
                Bennu likely broke off from a much larger carbon-rich asteroid about 700 million to 2 billion years ago. It likely formed in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and has drifted much closer to Earth since then. Because its materials are so old, Bennu may contain organic molecules similar to those that could have been involved with the start of life on Earth.                
                Bennu’s average orbital distance from the Sun is about 105 million miles (168 million kilometers), which is only slightly farther than Earth’s average orbital distance of 93 million miles.​</p>

            <p class="card-text text-light">A small asteroid with a 'marvelous' surprise.</p>
            <p class="card-text text-light">Dinkinesh is a small asteroid located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. On Nov. 1, 2023, NASA’s Lucy spacecraft flew by the asteroid, and sent back images showing that Dinkinesh has a moon, which has been named Selam.
                As Lucy continued to return data, the mission team was surprised to discover that Selam is a contact binary. In other words, it is made of two smaller objects touching each other. It's the first contact binary discovered orbiting an asteroid.
                In the first downlinked images of Dinkinesh and Selam, which were taken at closest approach, the two lobes of the contact binary appeared one behind the other from Lucy's point of view. Only when the team downlinked additional images, captured in the minutes around the encounter, was the true nature of this object revealed.
                “Contact binaries seem to be fairly common in the solar system,” said John Spencer, Lucy deputy project scientist, of the Boulder, Colorado, branch of the Southwest Research Institute. “We haven’t seen many up close, and we’ve never seen one orbiting another asteroid. We’d been puzzling over odd variations in Dinkinesh’s brightness that we saw on approach, which gave us a hint that Dinkinesh might have a moon of some sort, but we never suspected anything so bizarre!”

            <h2 class="card-title text-light">Vesta</h2>
            <p class="card-text text-light">Overview
              Vesta is the second most massive body in the main asteroid belt, accounting for almost 9% of the total mass of all asteroids. Only dwarf planet Ceres is more massive in that region of rocky debris between Mars and Jupiter. NASA’s Dawn spacecraft circled Vesta from July 16, 2011, until Sept. 5, 2012, when it departed and began its journey to dwarf planet Ceres.              
              The giant asteroid is almost spherical, and so is nearly classified a dwarf planet. Unlike most known asteroids, Vesta has separated into crust, mantle and core (a characteristic known as being differentiated), much like Earth.
              Understanding why this is so was one of the objectives of the Dawn mission. The answer turned out to be that Vesta formed early, within 1 to 2 million years of the birth of the solar system. Short-lived radioactive material that was incorporated into bodies that formed during this epoch heated them to the point where—in cases like Vesta—the objects melted, allowing the denser materials to sink to the asteroid's core and the lower density materials to rise. Vesta has one of the largest brightness ranges observed on any rocky body in our solar system. The bright materials appear to be native rocks, while the dark material is believed to have been deposited by other asteroids crashing into Vesta. Scientists on the Dawn team estimate that about 300 dark asteroids with diameters ranging from one to 10 km (0.6 to six miles) hit Vesta during the last 3.5 billion years. This would have been enough to wrap the Vesta in a blanket of material about three to seven feet (one to two meters) thick.
              An extensive system of troughs encircles Vesta's equatorial region. The largest, named Divalia Fossa, is bigger than the Grand Canyon.

            <h3 class="card-title text-light">Eros</h3>
            <p class="card-text text-light">Eros is famous as the first asteroid to be orbited by a spacecraft, and the first asteroid to have a spacecraft land on it. But Eros was important to astronomers as far back as 1898 when it became the first near-Earth asteroid (NEA) to be discovered.
              The NEAR spacecraft first flew by Eros on Dec. 23, 1998, at a distance of about 2,400 miles (about 3,800 kilometers) and found that the asteroid was smaller than expected and had two medium-sized craters, a long surface ridge, and a density similar to that of Earth's crust. After several trajectory adjustments, NEAR finally moved into orbit around Eros on Valentine's Day (befitting an asteroid named for the Greek god of love), Feb. 14, 2000.             
              After nearly a year in orbit, during which time the spacecraft was renamed "NEAR Shoemaker" in honor of astrogeology pioneer Eugene Shoemaker, the mission carried out humanity's first asteroid landing on Feb. 12, 2001. Eros was 196 million miles (315 million kilometers) from Earth at the time.             
              The spacecraft wasn't expected to survive the landing but its instruments remained operational, leading to yet another milestone. "This is the first gamma-ray experiment that has ever been done on the surface of a body other than Earth," said Dr. Jacob Trombka of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. "In fact, we can say it's the first feasibility study of how to design an instrument to be used on a rover that could select samples from the surface, look for the presence of water, or map the surface for the purpose of future mining."             
              The spacecraft issued its final transmission from the surface of Eros on Mar. 1, 2001.</p>

            <h3 class="card-title text-light">Ida and Dactyl</h3>
            <p class="card-text text-light">Ida is the second asteroid visited by a spacecraft, and the first found to have its own moon. The moon was later named Dactyl.
              On Aug. 28, 1993, NASA's Galileo spacecraft flew by Ida at a distance of about 1,500 miles (about 2,400 kilometers) en route to Jupiter. (The spacecraft flew by another asteroid, Gaspra, on Oct. 29, 1991.) A little more than five months later, scientists studying the images Galileo sent back to Earth noticed that a tiny moon accompanied the asteroid.             
              "It was previously thought that natural satellites of asteroids could form, but they probably weren't common," said Torrence Johnson, Galileo's project scientist. "Having found one fairly quickly, we can say that they're probably more common than previously thought." Located in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter, Ida is one of the Koronis family of asteroids, which are thought to be the debris of an ancient collision between two larger objects. It is covered in craters and a deep layer of regolith (pulverized rock).
              "Ida's age is baffling because the craters visible on its surface suggest that it is old, but being a part of the Koronis family suggests it is younger," Johnson said.             
              Ida is an S-type asteroid, composed mainly of silicate rock. This type of asteroid dominates the inner region of the asteroid belt, but comprises only about 17 percent of all known asteroids.</p>
